# Sanjay's HTS 3084 Final Project

## Welcome!
* This is my final project for HTS 3084. The goal of this project was to create an interactive medium for our class to work with some of the famous encryption techniques throughout history (Enigma and RSA)

## Usage
* Usage is very straightforward: head over to https://sanjaymhtsfinalproject.herokuapp.com/ and try encrypting some data!

## Code
* The code for the Flask backend is located at [app.py](https://github.com/sanjayMamidipaka/htsfinalprojectnew/blob/main/app.py) and the code for the frontend is located at [index.html](https://github.com/sanjayMamidipaka/htsfinalprojectnew/blob/main/templates/index.html)

## Enjoy!
